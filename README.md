[puppeteer-cluster](https://github.com/thomasdondorf/puppeteer-cluster) is a great library manages a
[puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) cluster. This is re-implementation to make it work with 
[Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright), aiming at 100% API compatibility as a turn-key replacement.

## Install

`npm --save @zhaow-de/playwright-cluster`

## Usage

The documentation from puppeteer-cluster is still valid as the reference.

## Note

1. Chromium is hardcoded as the headless browser. This library does not work with Firefox or Webkit.
2. `BrowserContext` is not available in Puppeteer. Some options, e.g. `ignoreHTTPSErrors` cannot be directly translated from 
   `puppeteerOptions` to `playwrightOptions`. Therefore, we introduced `contextOptions` as an optional property in `ClusterOptions`.
